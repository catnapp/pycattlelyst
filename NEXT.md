## hard questions x hopefully some answers

### what should be the initial rules for the first iteration? how to decide?
- helps if the rule makes the stage gen process more simple
- should be enough complexity to be an interesting game

ok lets decide on which of these two rules to go ahead with

- cows teleport away after the fart - this makes the stage empty out over time
- cows don't go anywhere - this makes the stage stay the same over time and also:
  - infinite farts because cows just stay there
  - stage gen will be more complex because we now have to pepper cows that we need to fart-move the cows into the pens for a win. this means more possibilities to consider
  - could lead to an interesting mechanics chain

> ðŸ’¡ reaction based mechanics? timing the fart properly

> building machines out of the systems. puzzle becomes how do you complete the machine. win condition based __rate__ of cows funnelled into pens



### can a world state be mapped to many distinct previous world states, or just one?
this one really depends on the rules


### should actions be included in states
yes. a world state w/o actions would be considered a stable state - these are states where players can act. while a state is unstable it'll need to be ran through the reducer some more
